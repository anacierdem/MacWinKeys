# MacWinKeys

Karabiner Private XML and Rule JSON to make MacOS keys familiar to Windows.

I've tried to bring as much as possible to the Karabiner to make reconfiguration easier.

Navigate to 

`karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anacierdem/MacWinKeys/master/KarabinerElementsRule.json`

on Safari to install on Karabiner-Elements.

I also use https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=Home%20and%20End
